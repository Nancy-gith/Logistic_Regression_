# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a **logistic regression model** to predict whether breast cancer is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**.  
Itâ€™s designed as a beginner-friendly tutorial for learning binary classification, logistic regression concepts, and hands-on implementation using **Python** and **Scikit-learn** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of **569 samples** of fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Each sample includes:  
- **ID number**  
- **Diagnosis**: M = malignant, B = benign  
- **30 numerical features** describing cell nuclei characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, smoothness, concavity).  

**No missing values** are present.  
**Class distribution:**  
- 357 benign  
- 212 malignant

## Project Objectives
- Understand **binary logistic regression** and its mathematical foundation  
- Learn how to preprocess datasets for machine learning  
- Implement a logistic regression model using **Scikit-learn**  
- Evaluate the model using **accuracy**, **classification reports**, and confusion matrices  
- Provide a beginner-friendly walkthrough with explanations and code examples

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for building the logistic regression model
